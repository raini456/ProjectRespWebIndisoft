Dear Yasamin,

howe are you? Hopefully not too busy :-)
I am just sitting in the bus to Magdeburg to have the job interview =20
and I am curious what comes out.
The whole concept of the job is so far very interesting because it =20
offers a fixed contract and beside gives the oportunity to work for a =20
longer time in different places in Germany. It would be exactly the =20
thing that would fit best in this phase of my life.

When I read your message I became a bit concerned when you write you =20
lost some interest in many things. As long as you are doing well I =20
think that will be no problem and often it is a short phase, but 2 =20
weeks is not sooo short ;-) ... As far as I know you I think you can =20
reflect on this with awareness, so I am sure you can handle it, but =20
when I read it there was a little voice in me that said: well, be =20
mindful with this desinterest.

Today I ended my training at Indisoft sith the end of the first of =20
three modules - quite a good lesson in different aspects.
First of all I made the expericence that I can learn as well in a =20
public library the way Indisoft offers the contents. That was the main =20
reason to quit.
Second there was a woman at the reception I got trouble with: when I =20
wanted to leave on day five minutes before the end of school she =20
notice this as missed schooltime. I asked her if she was serious about =20
that (at Mr. Backhaus we could have missed three hours without =20
noticing :-) ...). When I asked her if I should bring a document for =20
the doctor I was heading to she said: "Yes, that would be good ..." =20
Noone ever at the Arbeitsagentur is interested in those lists, that=C2=B4s =
=20
so ridiculess. Later after my doctor=C2=B4s visit I called her and told her =
=20
that if she treats me another time like this I would end the contract. =20
All she said was "I am not interested". When I mentioned my state of =20
handicap she seriously said: "Machen Sie nicht auf die Mitleidstour!" =20
And when I asked then for her supervisor she said: "I don=C2=B4t have any!".
I then decided to end the training after the first module. I had a =20
talk some days later with a councellor of Indisoft, a very =20
understanding woman who was deeply concerned about the treatment and =20
who apologized deeply. That was really moving. She said that Indisoft =20
will make no problems to end the contract.
But now the trouble just started: when I told my offical in charge at =20
the agency she refused to let me out of the contract. For some reasons =20
I seemingly cause some projection at her, she had treated me strange =20
already at my last visit with her. Well, that really upset me and as I =20
worked in a complaints office for nearly a week and already 30 years =20
as a social worker I of course know the ways how to handle that. I =20
wrote to the management and told them my trouble with her and that she =20
wouldn=C2=B4t react to a pretty discriminating situation with an =20
educational institute and some days later I got two letters in my post =20
from the management who apologized several times and told me that of =20
course I could end the training immediately or whenever I want. I =20
can=C2=B4t tell you what big relief that was. To have people like the =20
understanding woman at Indisoft or people in an agency who are on your =20
side. With whom you don=C2=B4t have the feeling you need to fight. I mean: =
=20
this should be the normal situation with a offical in charge, someone =20
who tries to help you ... Well finally I am now very happy to be out =20
of it again (well, I have my dear friend and doctor Wilhelm who always =20
would write me sick :-) ...) so I don=C2=B4t feel forced to go somewhere. =
=20
But the feeling this at people instead of putting their stuff on you =20
are really caring - I am so thankful for that. My last action when I =20
left Indisoft was to thank that woman again and she told me that this =20
meant very much to her. WOW, there a still living souls on this planet =20
:-)

So far. Ah, one thing still: I am celebrating my birthday on October =20
20th - only a small meeting with some good friends, not very big. I =20
would be happy I can come, too.
And on Saturday I will meditate again for the whole day - it becomes a =20
custom meanwhile. And in 9 day I will have the next interview in Bonn =20
:-)

Now so far for today, all the best out of the bus, regards and hugs

Stefan
